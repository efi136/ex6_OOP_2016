README (this file)
DirectoryProcessor.java - the DirectoryProcessor class.

======================
=      Design        =
======================
I chose to implement a functor Filter. I used this functor to filter the files.
The constructor of the Filter class removes the need for a factory.
Also, I chose to implement this as a private class because there is no need to
add this class to the API, nor do we want to use it elsewhere.
It was the best solution I could think of.
I also used some custom Comparator classes to use with java's sort.


=========================
= Implementation Issues =
=========================
There were no issues with the implementation.
It was straight forward.

None.
