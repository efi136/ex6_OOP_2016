======================
=      Design        =
======================
We devided the assignment to four parts.
FileParser - 
	The file parser. It is not complicated. Simply reads the file and acts as
	the gateway to the code for all the other files.
	This class has an array of Strings that contain the lines of the code.
	It also deals with the comments and whitespaces.
Exceptions - 
	The exceptions are pretty straight forward. The all inherit from Ex6Exception.
	Each one is for a specific type of error.
	They all have a method for printing the error to the screen using System.err.
Symbols - 
	This package deals with all of the Variables.
	We used a symbol table to hold all of the known symbols (functions, variables, globals)
	for each block.
	The variables deal with all of the operation that are related to them like devlerations and
	assignments.
CodeBlocks -
	Here we have the classes that deal with the more high level operations.
	If blocks, while blocks, methods. These can contain several lines.
	Each code block is a class that has its own SymbolTable. Every codeBlock
	has a compile method that handles all of the code for this block.
	When facing such block, calling the compile methods deals with the block like 
	it was a one_liner and after it you can proceed to the next block.
	This design resembles recursive compilation.
	
A more detailed explenation for each function can be found in the javadoc.

=========================
=   Questions           =
=========================
6.1:
We handled the errors using exceptions.
Each type of error had its own exception class. When running into an error 
we throw an exception and catch it in the main validator function. Meaning
we try to compile the code and if we hit an error we notify the main method and
handle the error properly there. We print the error message using the catched 
exception and print 1 to the screen.

6.2:
A.
	In order to include more variable types in our code we would need to create 
	anouther class that would inherit from variable and change the generic regular
	expretion of the variable class to include the other classes type and value.
	Simply add a class and Change 3 lines.
B.
	1. 
		In order to add a unary and binary operators we would have to add a Term class.
		In this class we would have all the necessery regular expretions to identify it,
		A function to check if a line part is a term and a compile metod similar to the ones
		in WhileBlock that will handle the compilation of the parts of the term.
	2.
		In order to add switch statements we would need to create a switchBlock calss similar
		to ifBlock and whileBlock. it would have all the functions that they have with the
		specifications of a switch block. (it is very similar, we don't think there is any need for
		more details.)
6.3:
	1.
		The METHOD_CALL = Variable.NAME_REGEX + "\\s*"
			+ "[(]\\s*("+Variable.VALUE_OR_NAME+"\\s*(\\s*,\\s*"+Variable.VALUE_OR_NAME+"\\s*)*)?[)]\\s*;";
		We used it to identify a method call.
		It consists of smaller regexps we defined in other classes.
	2.
		The NAME_REGEX = "(((_)((\\w)+))|(([a-zA-Z])(\\w*)))"
		We used it to identify variable names.
		It checks all of the requirements for a variable name.
		name is any sequence (length > 0) of letters (uppercase or lowercase), digits and the underscore
		character ( ). name may not start with a digit. name may start with an underscore,
		but in such a case it must contain at least one more character (i.e., ’ ’ is not a legal name).
		Legal name examples: ’g2’, ’b 3’, ’ ’, ’ a’, ’ b’, ’ 0’, ’a ’.
		Illegal name examples: ’2g’, ’ ’, ’2 ’, ’54 a’, ’3 3 3 b’.
